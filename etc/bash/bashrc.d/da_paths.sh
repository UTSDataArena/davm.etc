## echo Set paths

# Adding omegalib paths
# [Darren 10Apr14]
#
# Order is important, as it would otherwise find the wrong build of osg

## Moving equalizer includes to a symlink
## [Darren 8May14]

## Added paths to /da/sw/osg
## [Darren 22May14]

## osg now in /da/sw/osg/install
## omegalib symlink is /da/sw/omegalib/bin now links to /da/sw/omegalib/install/omegalib/bin
## Added osg-related paths
## [Darren 27May14]

## removing the omegalib paths, since we are using a wrapper to set them when different
## versions are running now
## [Darren 4Jul14]

# Add these directories to the front, or the end, of the Standard Data Arena User PATH
# Files in directories at the front are favoured to any that appear later.
